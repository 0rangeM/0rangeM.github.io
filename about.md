# About

My name is Morgan Rogers.
I'm currently (until the end of 2021) a PhD student at Universit√† degli Studi dell'Insubria, in Como, Italy. I study topos theory; my advisor is [Olivia Caramello](https://www.oliviacaramello.com/).
COVID-19 has kept me stuck at home in the UK, but I have very little to complain about.
